An online store needed a specific database, and they requested the creation of a simple database to easily manage their operations. The online store wanted the flexibility to create the database on an SQL Server if needed, without relying on external assistance. Additionally, they aimed to empower their small branches by launching a Python-based user interface. This objective was successfully achieved, and a Power BI management dashboard was also implemented as part of the project.
