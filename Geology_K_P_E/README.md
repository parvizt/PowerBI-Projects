When drilling is conducted by oil rigs, obtaining information about subsequent stages and discovering oil reservoirs in the Earth's layers is crucial. It requires an informational dashboard that continuously updates to visualize and update the subsequent stages or data, enabling the monitoring of processes to prevent both human and equipment errors. Therefore, data is entered through SQL Server, and a database is created. The data is then transferred to a Power BI management dashboard, utilized in the geological department of an oil company for exploration purposes.
