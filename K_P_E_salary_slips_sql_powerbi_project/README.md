The Kish Oil Company is a trading and service-oriented company in the oil sector. In this project, based on three consecutive years of salary slips, a management dashboard has been developed using Power BI. The data is first stored in a database through SQL, and then directed by Power BI for design and analytical processing. The data is organized into multiple separate sheets, allowing the respective manager to easily review their salary slips by monthly data editing in SQL and subsequently observing the results in Power BI.
